good work to do:
 
 
I’d like you to start working on a brand new Faceio article. Please focus on the keywords "face authentication," "face recognition," and "passwordless authentication," highlighting how Faceio addresses these issues.

Target developers directly, avoiding lengthy introductions. Include code samples from our website, relevant screenshots, and direct links to the Faceio site. make sure the article goes viral

The team is counting on me to make this a success!

An AI app to review uploaded resumes and make jokes from, but can only be accessed after facial authentication with FACEIO


first, create the outline for this project

also the UI, list all the pages needed

From sign up and authticate and login with FACEIO
to uploading resumes, to getting AI jokes, all of it

Project Overview and Goals

Objective: Create a web app where users authenticate via face recognition, upload resumes, and receive AI-generated jokes roasting the content.
Key Features:
Passwordless authentication using FACEIO for enrollment (sign-up) and authentication (login).
Secure file upload only post-authentication.
Resume parsing to extract text.
AI integration to generate 5-10 jokes based on resume details (e.g., skills, experience).
Privacy focus: No raw biometrics stored; anonymized hashes via FACEIO.

Target Audience: Developers experimenting with biometrics and AI; potential for viral sharing on dev communities.



Do a quantum research on FACEIO, their team, product, mission, vision, locations, business, goals, partners, customers, every content they have ever published

Now we are building an AI resume joker app with facial authentication

Note, we already got a working app @. 

It's to setup the actual FACEIO integration and the AI integration

Do you get it?

First review the current project @. 

Check exactly what has been done, and what we got to do

From what I checked, we got to install the FACEIO SDK

Create an env file

Add the FACEIO public app ID, add the API key

Add the full FACEIO Integration

And also install the Vercel or Groq AI SDK, get the API key and add it too

After all is setup, we then document each step and write a technical article on it

Explaining everything

The full codebase

Then project tree

How we created the Frontend UI

All of it
